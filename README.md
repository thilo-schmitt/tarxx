# tarxx

`tarxx` is intended to be a modern C++ (i.e. C++17) header-only 
library for dealing with `tar`-format files.

This was written for self-educational purposes only and is (at 
least for the moment) merely a quick rough hack. It is far from 
what I would call a professional grade project and by no means 
complete or finished. It might get better over time, it might 
get more complete over time and it might get more polished over 
time - in every aspect of it.
